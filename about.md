This is a site for me to compile notes and code looking at insulin pump and CGM data. My goal is to gain a better understanding of how insulin and blood glucose interact, specifically for my daughter, and maybe even figure out how to better manage her diabetes. 

The Jupyter notebooks and code all live on my github "sugar" repository: https://github.com/michellejw/sugar.

Here's the equipment I'm working with:
- Omnipod 5 insulin pump [link](https://www.omnipod.com/what-is-omnipod/omnipod-5)
- Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor

I have a [Glooko](https://glooko.com/) account where data from both of these devices is collated and analyzed. As awesome as it is, I don't always see exactly the information I want to see on the Glooko site which is what prompted me to do my own data crunching. Glooko has a nice export feature where you can export all of your data (basal, bolus, cgm, alarms, etc.) into several csv files. I've basically dumped this data as-is into the data folder in my "sugar" github repo.
